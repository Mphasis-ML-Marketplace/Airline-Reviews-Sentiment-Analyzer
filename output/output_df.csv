" Munich to Oslo. Paid for premium Economy got cattle class. Given boarding passes with the seats that we had reserved no problems at the check in counter. Got to the gate and our seats had been changed. Travel as a couple and shocked to find that we were no longer even in the same row, but squeezed between two other strangers. No space left for our bags the bins were filled by other passengers walking to the rear ended up put in the staff locker so could not access. No form of entertainment a very uncomfortable flight and certainly not what we had paid for. cabin crew seemed unfriendly and just going through the motions. I guess we were lucky only delayed for a short period before take-off but not a flight I would like to repeat in a hurry.",Negative
" Frankfurt to Chicago via Stockholm. Just awful. Was scheduled to leave at 4:30pm. They announced a delay due to the plane needing digital scanning. About an hour later they announced another delay in boarding. At 6:30pm they let us know that all the beverages onboard needed to be scanned and they would keep us posted. At 7:30pm we were told we would leave at 8:30. At almost 9:00 they announced the flight was canceled. After waiting over 4 hours at the gate we had to stand in line another hour to get a hotel assignment. The staff was totally unhelpful. They wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell us any new flight information, we were just told to go online. When I went online to look for my new flight it said I have already taken my flight. I feel like IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m being held hostage by SAS. This airline is completely incompetent. If there is a problem with the aircraft, bring in a new one. If there are problems with the beverages, take them off and load new ones. The staff wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t answer questions, they were completely rude. I hope to never have to fly this awful airline ever again. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m hoping when I get back to the airport I can get some answers as to when I will be able to fly home. I would not recommend flying SAS. United, Lufthansa and IcelandAir are much niceer and more competent.",Negative
" Manchester to Stockholm. Checking in online there was a fault and the App did not indicate what is was which caused some frustrating attempts to do it. After that everything went smoothly, they don't charge for bikes which is refreshing but they want you to specify that you have a bike in your bag. Probably so they can take more care of it. No food on the flight but coffee and tea provided. No entertainment on flight, well it was only 2 hours. No reclining seats but plenty of legroom. Enjoyable flight.",Positive
" The worst - they cancel many flights every day - shame shame shame on them. You buy ticket with only 50% chance of getting on at that time. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve cancelled 6 out of my 6 flights in last 12 mo (always in direction of Stockholm to London). They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fill the flight, so put me on a flight 2-4 hours later. Not acceptable when traveling for business was frequently. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never known another airline to do this so blatantly. Shame on them!",Negative
" Copenhagen to Tokyo Narita. SAS is a comfortable and excellent airline to travel with. I have choosen SAS for travel nearly 40 years, domestic Norway and international. I have tried other airlines, but my favorite remains the same. My flight to Narita was on time, relaxing and with excellent comfort. Staff made me feel welcomed and was professionals who knew what service is required. Food tasty with a variety of dishes to choose from. Inflight entertainment with a large selection of movies, mostly new, but also some classics from the past. Seat comfort in business gives plenty of room for sleep or just lounging. Wifi needs some improvement, Smooth journey and a very comfortable experience.",Positive
 Me and my family are booked on the SK595 flight on 8.30am in the morning. We got there early waiting for our flight and at around 9am we found out that our flight was cancelled. Luckily they rebooked us on the other flight at 2.30pm. I hate this airline and wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t consider flying with it again. They really ruined our plan for the day. Star alliance should really consider kicking them out of the group!,Negative
" Copenhagen to Berlin. Had planned a surprise trip for my mother as she is turning 80 this week. Took her to the airport, when she discovers her purse is gone (incl ID/passport). Before heading up to the check-in counters, I call SAS and explain the situation and also mention that I am Star Alliance Gold (on SAS). The guy answering does not have a clue. After repeated nudging, it turns out that for 600+USD, we could potentially fly on a later flight. I am not asking for the moon, but a little compassion and cooperation now and then with your most loyal customers would go a long way.",Negative
" Copenhagen to Berlin. Delayed flight and not really low fare. Wondering, why, when having such strong competition with Norwegian and easyJet being punctual and such low cost, how could you consider selecting SAS next time after such a bad experience? I got an acknowledgment that the flight was actually overbooked and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get any seat assigned, fortunately two passengers didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t show up. Amazing really.",Negative
" Stockholm to London. I was just rather surprised and disappointed. My 3 year old son was undergoing surgery in London so I rushed back to the airport and given a call ended early I was able to just show up at the gate as the earlier flight was boarding. Explained my situation - would love to see him when he wakes up from general anesthesia. Then I was told I needed to wait to see whether there are any free seats. Of course! Then I was told that there are four seats free in coach but they deny to take me because I had booked an inflexible ticket. Offered to pay and they have no ability to take payment even at customer service. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what to say other than I am stranded at the airport for another three hours and feel that I was just treated a bit inhumanly. Gold star with star alliance back and forth, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather let an airplane leave with empty seats and have me sit here than making an exception, or charging me for it. Oh well the surgery went well and the little one is OK. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the important things that count.",Negative
" Bologna to Newark via Copenhagen. I ha a long wait for my connection to Newark on 6.35 p.m. Two hours before my departure Sas sent me an SMS: the flight was 3 hours late. I was given a bonus of 10 euro for lunch! I landed in Newark at midnight. On 19th April I had my flight at 11.30 p.m. but was late again. I left at 12.45 p.m. and arrived in Copenaghen 3 p.m. my connection to Bologna was 5.30 p.m, late by 30 minutes. It was a nightmare.",Negative
" After reading several critical reviews I feared the worse. As a regular global business traveller I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly. Now for this trip I flew with my family in Economy cattle class, so expectations were not too high. Check-in was fine, paying for seats of choice should not be necessary, but overall was acceptable. Boarding was well organized, although I am still amazed by the chaotic management of the Newark Airport. Due to a technical failure with a previous El Al airplane at our gate, the SAS aircraft could not get to the gate. The Airport authorities misreported the delay was caused due late arrival of the SAS airplane, however we saw it landing 2 hours in advance, so no blame to SAS here. Then the flight itself, it was a very good stable journey, hardly any turbulence and when there was the pilot did his best to fly around. The seats were fine, I have seen much worse. Interior was clean and nothing broken. Entertainment was one of the best and I usually travel business class. Overall I am positively surprised and satisfied with SAS. I would for sure fly with them again. Do not expect overly luxuries like Emirates, but affordable, clean, well organized, friendly and safe travel.",Positive
" Miami to Athens via Copenhagen. Horrible service. In Miami they wanted to wheel me on my own and take me away from my husband who was travelling with me and also on a wheelchair! They were insisting as they said they had no other wheelchairs available! I have been travelling for the past 10 years and never have I had any airline separate me from my husband because of the lack of a chair! My daughter had to complain for them to understand I was sick and could not be alone without my husband so then we waited for 30 minutes for another chair to arrive. I thought that this would be the end of the poor service but it continued well into the flight. Horrible food, ""cold"" flight attendants who know nothing about hospitality and when we arrived in Copenhagen again the problem with the lack of wheelchairs. If you are disabled or old (or plainly want to travel with good service) do not travel with this airline.",Negative
" Newark to Oslo. I live in Philadelphia, but I flew from Newark because there is a non-stop flight to Oslo. I checked in for the flight EWR to OSL, but when I arrived at Newark Airport at 5PM for a 7PM flight, SAS told me they had canceled the 7PM flight and moved me to an 11:30 flight to Copenhagen. I had received no text message or email, though they had both my mobile and my email address on record. The service agent added the information that the same flight had been canceled the day before as well. I had the feeling when there aren't enough people on the flight to run it profitably, they just cancel the flight and route everyone through Copenhagen.",Negative
 Flew SAS Scandinavian from Copenhagen to Athens. Worse than a low cost at premium price. This time we were travelling with our baby and the service was simply horrible. They wouldn't allow us to take the trolley to the plane door even though it is an ultra compact trolley. Had to pay one extra piece of luggage for the baby carrier (babybjorn backpack). Disallow a sound book to calm a crying baby (nobody complained). Charged 3 euros to refill the baby bottle with water (really?). Seemed that they are trying to avoid the family flyers. We had much better experiences with any low cost!,Negative
" Copenhagen to Vilnius via Riga. SAS has delegated operation of the route between Copenhagen and Vilnius to Air Nostrum. Ever since that happened, there have never been so many delays and cancellations on this route, much to the irritation of frequent flyers like myself. This Friday was no exception. 5 minutes after boarding, the flight to Vilnius was cancelled, and all passengers were told to go to the Transfer Center in Copenhagen airport. I was then told I had been re-routed to Vilnius with AIr Baltic via Riga. I thought this was no big deal, however SAS refused me to get a Business Class seat with Air Baltic claiming ""the product you bought doesn't exist"". I then argued and asked how the product cannot exist when it clearly stated on my boarding card I was in business. I even provided the invoice stating my purchase in business. Bottom line is that SAS couldn't care less, and with their normal arrogant attitude I was sent onto Air Baltics old propeller machines in Economy Class, and eventually got to Vilnius with a 4 hour delay. All this is just not good enough. SAS has really turned into a low-cost airline, and at this time I have no confidence in this cheap airline. They sold me a product, and claimed it doesn't exist? Sorry, that is downright dumb. If SAS wants returning customers, they should really sharpen the pencil regarding customer service - in the airport as well as on board. Their prices are horribly high, and they still have monopoly on some routes, which is why they can charge Ã¢â€šÂ¬ 350 for a 1Ã‚Â½ flight. Not recommended at all.",Negative
" Rome to Helsinki via Copenhagen. I missed the flight of Norwegian due to the delayed trains in Italy so we had to book new airplane ticket to go back Helsinki on the same day (because I have to work on the next day). I booked a SAS airplane ticket with 8 hour transit at Copenhagen airport which means I had to sleep at the Denmark airport that night and guess what. When I woke up, I got a message from the SAS airline apolozing that my flight from Copenhagen to Helsinki was cancelled !!!!!!!!!! And they said they would pay back the portion of money to me. Why can they be so irresponsible? I couldnt find or book any flight to go back Helsinki in that morning because all the tickets of another airlines were inavailable and I had to skip a work day.",Negative
" We arrived at Oslo airport to receive an email saying our flight had been cancelled, went to the desk where they had no reason why. Was told we had to fly to Stockholm and wait for a connecting flight to London. What should of been an 2 hour flight turned into a 4 hour flight plus hours of hanging around airports. Oslo airport at 11.30 got into London Airport at 5.40. First and last time using SAS Scandinavian.",Negative
" Flew SAS Scandinavian from Copenhagen to Beijing. Unbelievable that you pay for a premium economy class ticket which should include WIFI but the staff on board have no clue on how to get it to work. Would you not expect that there was a mechanism for them to turn it on manually? Yes, you would but there is not, you can either be lucky that the system works and accepts your ticket number and by the way you have to sign up for Eurobonus even that you are a Star Alliance Gold member. The whole thing makes absolutely no sense and this was one big disorganised clown show.",Negative
" Washington to Copenhagen. Exorbitant fees: will not fly SAS again. Fee for change of return date: $300, plus pricing policy that made it more expensive for me to change the return date than to buy a new return ticked with the same airline (SAS), on the same distance and the same date. Total cost given by SAS for changing the return date for this transatlantic flight: $800. I ended up buying a one-way ticket with a different airline rather than changing my return date with SAS. On the inbound flight, the extra luggage fee for this transatlantic flight was $120 per item, additional $120 for overweight on the same item: Total $240 for each overweight additional item. I have not paid fees remotely as high as this with any other airline.",Negative
" New York to Milan via Oslo. I flewto Portland with SAS for Christmas to visit my Family this year. That was the first time I've flown with SAS to US, because I thought they're a reliable company from Sweden that I can trust - however SAS is the worst airline company I've ever travelled. Their connecting flights are always delayed at least 1 hour (without exception), I've even missed a connection flight on the way back. They have delivered my baggage with delay on Christmas so I couldn't give my nephews their Christmas gifts on the day. Furthermore when I've returned back to Milano, they couldn't deliver my baggage at all (it has been a week since my baggage is still missing) so don't get tricked with marketing materials they promote. Unless you're flying inside Europe to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, I wouldn't recommend anyone using SAS.",Negative
